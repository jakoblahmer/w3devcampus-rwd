A1 Feedback:

    X I also wonder why wrapper has a width in px, in this assignment I like to see relative values where ever this has a duty, and I don't see what is the benefit for wrapper to have a static width.

    X Good you took the table out for the prices, only, as it is now I miss the relation between the different rooms since they are in separate sections. In my opinion better consider a description list.

    - The form, I notice that all input elements are inside a div, why?

    - Can you please be kind and for next assignment remove all CSS that has no duty in this assignment?
